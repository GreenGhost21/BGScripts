These are scripts that don't originate from any game. Instead, they were created by myself. These were made for the simfiles from zenius-i-vanisher.com, and often contain edits to difficulty numbers (to pre-DDR X values) and CDTitles (to change the format to the names seen here: https://github.com/MadkaT182/CdTitles/tree/master/Regular ) 

Feel free to use or modify them in any capacity, just please be sure to give credit to GreenGhost21 if these scripts are used, either as-is or edited. Credit where credit is due, and such.
