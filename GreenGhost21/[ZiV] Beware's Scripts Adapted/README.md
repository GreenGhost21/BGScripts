These contain scripts adapted from Beware's DDR EXTREME simulation for zenius-i-vanisher's own simfiles. The scripts also often contain difficulty numbers reverted back to pre-DDR X values if possible, and edited CDTitle paths (to point towards the names provided by this repository: https://github.com/MadkaT182/CdTitles/tree/master/Regular ). Any other changes are as noted.

Be absolutely sure to give beware ( https://zenius-i-vanisher.com/v5.2/user?userid=7437 ) credit if you use these, I only adapted their scripts to the ZiV simfiles. Also give me credit if I made a change in addition to the ones noted earlier. Credit where credit is due and all that.
