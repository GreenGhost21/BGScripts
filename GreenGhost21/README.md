# GreenGhost21's Scripts
In short, my scripts fall under two categories: self-made, and adapted from beware's own scripts.

You'll find each kind of script in the appropriate folder.

Some songs have two or more (re)mixes that have *very* similar beware's scripts. Often in those cases, I will make a version of the script for the remix that differs notably from the original version. For convenience's sake, I'll include both versions, each in the proper folder.

Permissions will be found in each folder. 

Do note that some videos use special, double-framerate videos (made by myself), for times when the rate needs to be above 200%. Said videos end in "x2" (referring to the doubled framerate), and will be available [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1uKVE5p5RtECdgjSZPn6iHbZUJrd7IM6V). Just put them in the RandomMovies folder.

Finally, I am planning on phasing out Beware's versions of the BG Videos in favor of the newer ones extracted from Festival (Generously relayed to me by CuzcoBlocko from the ZiV forums), given proper names by yours truly. So if you find you're missing a video for a script, [check the Google Drive link here](https://github.com/GreenGhost21/DDRFestival-Videos-Named)
