# GreenGhost21's Scripts
In short, my scripts fall under two categories: self-made, and adapted from beware's own scripts.

You'll find each kind of script in the appropriate folder.

Some songs have two or more (re)mixes that have *very* similar beware's scripts. Often in those cases, I will make a version of the script for the remix that differs notably from the original version. For convenience's sake, I'll include both versions, each in the proper folder.

Permissions will be found in each folder.
